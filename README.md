# 👋 Hi, I’m Rareș Ștefan Făgădeanu

🎓 I’m a **Computer and Systems Engineering student** at the **Politehnica University of Timișoara**.  
I’m passionate about **machine learning**, **hardware systems**, and **software development**, especially where these fields intersect.

I enjoy creating projects that connect **theory with real-world applications** — from data-driven simulations to interactive tools and games.  
You’ll find here a mix of **academic projects**, **personal experiments**, and **learning-based applications** that helped me grow as an engineer.
